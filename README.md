# Notion-APyClient
A thin Python wrapper around the Notion API

Documentation:  https://developers.notion.com/docs

API Reference:  https://developers.notion.com/reference/intro


TODO:
"Public Member Functions/Methods" - Design my API Interface and it's methods and 
structures by what is most efficient and useful for me
- `API Interface Template for all future APIs`
- Structure by what is most logical, easy, and useful for me and the related projects
- Start with a handful of methods representing their useful function/action in
"real life"
      * e.g. Task: "Create a new `Focus Block` page from the command-line" -> 
              Methods: query_database(), create_new_page(), etc.
  - Complex tasks may need to be broken down into several different functions and/or 
    API endpoint requests
  
'What & Why?'
---------------
Functionality:
- This Integration will be dedicated to the 'Manifestation Companion'
- `Good Feeling` / `Emotional Gridwork` cues/memories/appreciations Database
- `Attention Tithing` / `Manifestation` Framework
* Using CMD for easy & fast input --> Notion for GUI & visualization???

Notion + Python Usage:
+ Store and Fetch any data (Notion type compatible) from an Integration
+ Automate any possible Notion-user action
+ External connections & signal response


Notion Blocks & Objects:
``Integration``
`Database`: `Property`,
`Page`: `Property`,
`Block`: `Type`,
`Children`
`Search` API endpoint
`User` obj. (including bots)
`Rich text` obj.

# Code is the template & the logic! 
# CRUD -> Create, Read, Update, and Delete are the four basic operations of
# persistent storage

'Manifestation Companion' Components
`Vibrational Processes`
`Database/Archives` -> combination of disk and Notion?
`Interface` I/O -> Notion for visual, CMD for speed

System Modules:
`NotionAPI` -> handles all GET & POST requests
`Data_Parser` -> parses response data into a user-friendly format
`Program_Logic` -> applies any desired logic and/or transformations to 
                    user-formatted data
`Object_Translator` -> allows conversion of any user-formatted data to a 
                        Notion-friendly format
`Block_Builder` -> handles the construction of all Notion blocks and objects


??? CMD + Notion System ???

Tasks
- Create a new `Focus Block` page from cmd
- Get a random `Focus Block` page to 'review'
- Create a new `Basic Emotion Overlay` page from cmd
- Get a random `Basic Emotion Overlay` page to 'review'  
- 'Quick record' from cmd
- 'Quick record' from phone
- 'Quick record' from web

Methods
- 


Methods, Modules -> building blocks of OOP Structure 
Top-down & Bottom-up thinking; Systems and Modular thinking
- Start with a simple, clear & easy to use base structure and expand slowly with 
  intention
  - Plan well and efficiently
- Can always change and add-on as necessary
'What' & 'Why'
- 80/20
- Purpose of the "most relevant" Projects that will use my `API Interface`

+ Begin to incorporate TDD; Work Slowly and Intentionally
+ Tip a hat to "Public-usage" theories
+ Stay on top of good documentation
+ Keep using git & GitHub
+ "I am the best!": Always Enjoy and Have Fun!
